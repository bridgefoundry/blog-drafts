## Communication Stategy
In blogging and social media, our goal is the get the word out about the amazing work that is happening: from people and projects within our organizations, from any indiviudal or organization who is doing like-minded work and making an impact elsewhere, as well as 'untold stories' that will inspire our readers.

**Target audience**: workshop organizers, educators, people who want to make positive change to increase diversity in tech

We've developed the following categories to help us brainstorm future blog posts.  We should seek to create stories that are diverse in geography and encourage new writers and guest posts whenever possible to include a variety of voices.

1. Resources for
  * Organizers
  * Students (not for a specific technology, rather patterns for effective learning, finding your path, etc.)
  * Teachers
2. Stories / Highlight unsung heroes
  * Teachers / Coaches
  * Students
  * Organizers
  * Technology leaders / inventors
3. Illustrate the trend
  * Stats / Reports that include quanitative or qualitative analysis
  * Patterns - stories of people or other orgs doing amazing things, illustrating patterns that work
  * Highlight podcasts, videos, blog posts, resources: include at least a few sentences introduction, ideally some pull quotes, something that gives reader perspective on why they should care

## Publishing a post

Ready to have your post published?  After a draft is tagged as ready the outreach committee will give it a +1 and move it over to the blog.
